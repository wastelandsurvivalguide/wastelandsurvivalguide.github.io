First, generating LOD is not a requirement, but it will add detail in the distance thanks to the mod linked below. It becomes a requirement for proper visuals if you installed texture mods (such as NMCs or Poco Bueno) or are using a mod that requires LOD to be generated (like MoreMojave). Terrain LOD creates a much larger file size (+500mb) and potential performance loss for a very minimal visual improvement. Therefore, this guide will focus only on generating object LOD with xLODGen. If you need to generate xLODGen terrain LOD for whatever reason, the instructions will be the exact same except you will need to enable Terrain LOD option in addition to the Object LOD option.","sidebar":"appendixSidebar"},"mo2":{"id":"mo2","title":"Mod Organizer 2","description":"In this step, we will install and configure Mod Organizer 2.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"mods-avoid":{"id":"mods-avoid","title":"Mods to Avoid","description":"In this section we will go list some of the popular mods that shouldn\'t be used for Fallout New Vegas or","sidebar":"appendixSidebar"},"overhauls":{"id":"overhauls","title":"Overhauls","description":"The mods in this section may change the game dramatically, and some are very challenging.
