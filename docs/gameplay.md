### [Faster Pip-Boy Animation](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67761)

Modifies the Pip-Boy animation to be 2x or 3x faster than default. Works with most Pip-Boy mods. I suggest the 2x version.

### [Misc Gamesetting Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/72983)

Customizes some vanilla gamesettings with text files powered by Stewie's Tweaks. Select whatever you want in the installer; if you want to change your settings just reinstall the mod and select different options.
:::info Perk Every Level
This particular gamesetting tweak in this mod won't actually affect TTW due to a technicality, however TTW already grants a perk every level in non-Hardcore mode. If you want this for Harcore Mode, install [Hardcore Perk Every Level](overhauls#hardcore-perk-every-level).
