## Tweaks & Quality-Of-Life

### [Baka Skill Book Scanner](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75828)

Dynamic quest markers that highlight nearby skill books, anywhere, anytime

### [Better Caravan](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/81002)

Engine plugin significantly improving the usability of the Caravan minigame. Optionally fixes AI bugs to make opponents a little smarter.

### [Casino Exchange All](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/35701)

Trade in all Caps, Legion, NCR & (optionally) Pre-war Money at once, at the casino cashiers. Grab the optional file for voices too.

### [Delay DLC Redux TTW](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75851)

Prevents the game's DLC from spamming the new game startup messages and requires you be near a given DLC's starting location to receive its quest. **Read the description** so you understand how to start the DLCs with this mod installed.

### [Faster Pip-Boy Animation](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67761)

Modifies the Pip-Boy animation to be 2x or 3x faster than default. Works with most Pip-Boy mods. I suggest the 2x version.

### [Misc Gamesetting Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/72983)

Customizes some vanilla gamesettings with text files powered by Stewie's Tweaks. Select whatever you want in the installer; if you want to change your settings just reinstall the mod and select different options.
:::info Perk Every Level
This particular gamesetting tweak in this mod won't actually affect TTW due to a technicality, however TTW already grants a perk every level in non-Hardcore mode. If you want this for Harcore Mode, install [Hardcore Perk Every Level](overhauls#hardcore-perk-every-level).
