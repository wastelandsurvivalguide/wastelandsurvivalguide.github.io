## Load Order

This section ensures that your load order is correct for the guide by overwriting
MO2's `loadorder.txt` file. It's fine if you skipped any number of mods in the guide;
this process will still work.

Click the ![MO2 folder button](../static/img/mo2_folders.webp) button at the top of MO2 and select <button>Open Profile Folder</button>. Double-click `loadorder.txt` to open it in your text editor of choice and **replace** any existing contents with the following:

```txt title="C:\Users<YOUR USERNAME>\AppData\Local\ModOrganizer\TTW\profiles\Default\loadorder.txt"
# This file was automatically generated by Mod Organizer.
# ╔═════════════ Wasteland Survival Guide Load Order ══════════════╗
# ║ This is a file for MO2 to parse automatically; you don't need  ║
# ║ to read or edit it. Many listed mods are NOT part of the guide ║
# ║ and are only here as contingencies. Please ignore them!        ║

Press F5 to refresh MO2 and if everything went correctly, the list of plugins in the right pane will be reordered. If you installed all of the mods in the guide then the final plugin should be `CC - 3D Rain.esp`, however if you opted to skip some mods then it may be something else. This is fine, as long as you saw the list of plugins being reordered after refreshing.

Click the <button>**Create a Backup**</button> button so if something ever goes wrong you can instantly restore this load order:

# Finishing Notes

Congratulations! You now have a modded Tale of Two Wastelands setup to enjoy. For additional resources such as incompatible mods, performance tips, frequently asked questions and more, see the [Appendix](appendix). Join the [TTW Discord](https://discord.gg/taleoftwowastelands) if you have any additional questions about the guide, modding, or just to chill.

# Additional Mods

Check out our [Additions](additions) page for mods approved and recommended by our team that did not make it into the guide for one reason or another. Unfortunately, we do not have the time or energy to provide support for setups that install extra mods on top of the guide. We cannot stress enough that it is only recommended to add your own mods if you are an experienced modder and know how to manually make conflict resolution patches and sort your load order! If you don't know [how to do that](https://moddinglinked.com/themethod.html) in [xEdit](https://moddinglinked.com/xedit.html), or you are unwilling to spend the time to do so, it is not recommended to add your own mods. You can't just throw a bunch of mods on top of the guide without doing any conflict resolution, or use automated tools like LOOT as a substitute for proper conflict resolution, and expect your game to function as intended. Once again, **we will not support setups that have added any mods**.
