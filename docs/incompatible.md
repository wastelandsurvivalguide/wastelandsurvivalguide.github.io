# Incompatible Mods

---

###### Adapted from [TTW forum](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=6878)

This is by no means an exhaustive list, and the following points cannot be stressed enough:
:::caution Check for conflicts with xEdit
[Learn to use it](https://moddinglinked.com/xedit.html), no exceptions!
:::
:::danger Unconverted Fallout 3 Mods are Not Compatible
Any FO3 mods with .ESM/ESP and/or animations and meshes are not compatible!
:::
:::danger LOOT is useless with TTW!
LOOT relies on a masterlist being maintained by humans, and nobody maintains
that list for Fallout New Vegas, let alone for TTW. Consequently there is no underlying logic
when you use LOOT on TTW - your mods will essentially be randomized. **Don't use it!**

## Known to be Incompatible

#### Bug fixes mods, such as Yukichigai Unofficial Patch, Unofficial Patch NVSE Plus, et cetera. 
- YUPTTW and TTW Hotfix (if available) already fixes bugs on both games, using other bug fixes mods is redundant and may break the game instead. Engine fixes (such as lStewieAl's and JohnnyGuitar for example) will not break the game though, and you should already have it if following the guide.

#### Mission Mojave Ultimate Edition, and major overhauls such as FOOK, New Vegas Enhanced Content, DUST, etc. .   

- Very old and should not be used nowadays, and will introduce bugs on their own.

#### A Familiar Friend and Readius/Any hand-held Pip-Boy mods

- Use the [arm-mounted version](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/49732) or [Universal Pip-Boy Customization](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66598). You must revert to arm-mounted (if you're using UPBC0 before doing Tranquility Lane and Anchorage and taking the train to Vegas the first time. Use UPBC to make this and any other hand-held Pip-Boy work.

#### After War Nevada

- Completely incompatible.

#### Alt Start Mods

- Will break TTW's starting quest

#### Animation Replacers predating kNVSE like WAR/Hitman's (old)/Asurahs

- Incompatible with the mesh and animation fixes in TTW. Ironsights, reloads for Fallout 3 weapons and other things will not work correctly. kNVSE animations work fine.

#### Armor overhauls

- This includes NCR Overhaul, Legion Overhauls, Book of Steel (without patches), Spice of Life, and any other armor/outfit overhaul. Any of these will require extensive patching. Ones which use body replacers are not compatible period.

#### CAGE/CAE (Continue After Game Ending)

- Use [FPGE](content#fpge) instead.

#### CFW - Classic Fallout Weapons

- Completely incompatible, breaks leveled lists in both games, broken meshes, ctds. Use [Classic Fallout Weapons Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73805) instead.

#### CZ52 mod by kouoaeha

- Broken meshes and recompiles all scripts, will break TTW.

#### Enhanced NPC Awareness

- causes random NPCs and companions after firing to become hostile to the player among other issues.

#### FCO - Fallout Character Overhaul

- All versions are known to conflict and break TTW, do not install under any circumstances any part of it.
  - Use [Two Wastelands Redesigned](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73667) instead.
  
#### Most Fallout 3 mods

- TTW is a New Vegas mod, so mods loaded in FO3 will have no effect, and unconverted mods for FO3 will not work and break TTW. [Collision Meshes - DC](https://wastelandsurvival.guide/docs/optimizations#collision-meshes---dc) is an exception. 

#### Fallout 4 Commonwealth mods

- This includes armors, items, whatever. Leveled list problems, crashing, lag and other problems.

#### Fallout New California

- No _working_ patch exists (yes, including that one) and making one would be a tremendous amount of work.

#### Fallout Who Vegas

- Dialogue breaks and more, needs rebuilt to work correctly. (Your mod is a buggy mess, not TTW!)

#### Freeside Open and any other mod that makes changes to the Freeside worldspace

- Can be patched

#### GRA integration mods other than SawyerBatty.

- Mods such as Mojave Arsenal and others are incompatible with TTW. 

#### Game Setting Tuner

#### HeroinZero's Weapon Fixes compilation by axonis

- These are now fixed by kNVSE, JIP NVSE and Stewies tweaks at the engine level.

#### ILO - Interior Lighting Overhaul

- Old and incompatible, use the [SILO](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71390) or [Atmospheric Lighting Tweaks - TTW](https://wastelandsurvival.guide/docs/ambience#atmospheric-lighting-tweaks---ttw) instead (only use one or the other).

#### IMPACT

- incompatible hard edits to weapons, but the scripted [Impact Compatibility Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62050) will work fine.

#### Increased Wasteland Spawns

- causes massive save bloat and CTD's. Creatures will multiply. Outdated and should be avoided.
  - Use [The Living Desert](content#the-living-desert) for a more alive wasteland.

#### Any Killable Children mods

- Incompatible.

#### Leave Conversation

- Force closes dialogues, breaking scripts. Dialogue choices can become locked out, breaking the game.

#### MMM (Mart's Monster Mod)

- Could be patched but would take a lot of effort.

#### Megaton Walkway

- Completely breaks navmeshes in Megaton causing NPCs to teleport under Springvale, someone could fix it.

#### Monster Mod / MoMod

- Totally broken meshes that cause CTDs and broken leveled lists. If you must, try [MoMod Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71714).

#### Mods that edit companions looks/inventory/whatever directly.

  spelling and grammar errors abound.

- WILL break your game.

#### PLR - Point Lookout Reborn

- Can be patched/reconverted, broken scripts and broken/dirty worldspace/cell edits

#### Unlimited Companions

- Janky mod from 2010, use [JIP CC&C](https://wastelandsurvival.guide/docs/gameplay#jip-ccc) instead

#### WMX/WME (Weapon Mods Expanded)

- all meshes are incompatible with fixed animations and problems with texture sets, sound fixes and other issues.
  - Use [Unique Weapons Upgradeable](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77809) instead.

#### WMIM (Weapon Mesh Improvement Mod)

- Already included with TTW and more up to date. Not needed and will cause fix conflicts.

#### Weapons of the New Millenia/and Friends

- Use [Another Millenia](https://wastelandsurvival.guide/docs/content#another-millenia) instead.

#### Weapons of the Wasteland

- Causes CTDs.

#### XFO

- Ancient; not even compatible with the current version of vanilla New Vegas.

#### Zan Autopurge Crash Protector

- WILL break your game.

#### Anything that alters the game's timescale

- Internal game functions are tied to time scale , changing them will break AI packages and other things.

## Probably Incompatible

- Version differences in TTW mean that compatibility is sometimes out of the question in this situation.

#### Custom Race Mods

- Lack child races, cause CTDs.
