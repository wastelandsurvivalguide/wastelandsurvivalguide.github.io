# Incompatible Mods
---

###### Adapted from [TTW forum](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=6878)

This is by no means an exhaustive list, and the following points cannot be stressed enough:

:::caution Check for conflicts with xEdit

Learn to use it, no exceptions!

:::

:::danger Unconverted Fallout 3 Mods are Not Compatible

Any FO3 mods with .ESM/ESP and/or animations and meshes are not compatible!

:::

:::danger LOOT is useless with TTW!

LOOT relies on a masterlist being maintained by humans, and nobody maintains
that list for Fallout New Vegas, let alone for TTW. Consequently there is no underlying logic
when you use LOOT on TTW - your mods will essentially be randomized. **Don't use it!**

## Known to be Incompatible

#### A Familiar Friend

- use arm mounted version or universal pipboy mod. You must revert to arm mounted before doing Tranquility Lane and Anchorage and taking the train to Vegas the first time. Use universal Pipboy to make this and readius work.

#### After War Nevada

- completely incompatible.

#### Alt Start Mods

- Will break TTW's starting quest

#### Animation Replacers predating kNVSE like WAR/Hitman's (old)/Asurahs

- incompatible with the mesh and animation fixes in TTW. Ironsights, reloads for Fallout 3 weapons and other things will not work correctly. kNVSE animations work fine.

#### Armor overhauls

- this includes NCR Overhaul, Legion Overhauls, Book of Steel (without patches), Spice of Life, and any other armor/outfit overhaul. Any of these will require extensive patching. Ones which use body replacers are not compatible period.

#### CAGE/CAE (Continue After Game Ending)

- Use [FPGE](content#fpge) instead.

#### CFW - Classic Fallout Weapons

- completely incompatible, breaks leveled lists in both games, broken meshes, ctds. Use [CFW Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73805).

#### CZ52 mod by kouoaeha

- broken meshes and recompiles all scripts, will break TTW.

#### Cinemodded Fallout and Patches

- Uses many old and incompatible mods, game breaking ones such as NVEC, CFW and FOOK (which are listed above)

#### Clear Cache Hotkey

- WILL break your game.

#### DUST - Survival simulator

- completely incompatible; broken mod with over 1,000 errors in xEdit.

#### EVE

- incompatible weapon meshes and animations. Try [Energy Visuals Plus 2.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/80000) instead.

#### Enhanced NPC Awareness

- causes random NPCs and companions after firing to become hostile to the player among other issues.

#### FCO - Fallout Character Overhaul

- All versions are known to conflict and break TTW, do not install under any circumstances any part of it.
- Use [Two Wastelands Redesigned](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73667) instead.

#### FOOK New Vegas

- Completely incompatible; avoid all outdated "total overhauls" such as this.

#### Fallout 3 mods

- TTW is a New Vegas mod, so mods loaded in FO3 will have no effect, and unconverted mods for FO3 will not work and break TTW.

#### Fallout 4 Commonwealth mods

- This includes armors, items, whatever. Leveled list problems, crashing, lag and other problems.

#### Fallout New California

- No _working_ patch exists (yes, including that one) and making one would be a tremendous amount of work.

#### Fallout Who Vegas

- Dialogue breaks and more, needs rebuilt to work correctly. (Your mod is a buggy mess, not TTW!)

#### Freeside Open and any other mod that makes changes to the Freeside worldspace

- can be patched

#### GRA integration mods other than SawyerBatty.

#### Game Setting Tuner

- broken, bad scripting that causes save bloat and corruption.

#### HeroinZero's Weapon Fixes compilation by axonis

- These are now fixed by kNVSE, JIP NVSE and Stewies tweaks at the engine level.

#### ILO - Interior Lighting Overhaul

- Old and incompatible, use the lighting mod in the WSG instead

#### IMPACT

- incompatible hard edits to weapons, but the scripted [Impact Compatibility Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62050) will work fine.

#### Increased Wasteland Spawns

- causes massive save bloat and CTD's. Creatures will multiply. Outdated and should be avoided.
- Use [The Living Desert](content#the-living-desert) for a more alive wasteland.

#### Killable Children (any)

- Incompatible.

#### Leave Conversation

- Force closes dialogues, breaking scripts. Dialogue choices can become locked out, breaking the game.

#### MMM (Mart's Monster Mod)

- could be patched but would take a lot of effort.

#### MMUE - Mission Mojave Ultimate Edition

- Deletes records TTW needs and reuses Fallout 3 records, it WILL break TTW.

#### Megaton Walkway

- Completely breaks navmeshes in Megaton causing NPCs to teleport under Springvale, someone could fix it.

#### Monster Mod / MoMod

- totally broken meshes that cause CTDs and broken leveled lists. If you must, try [MoMod Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71714).

#### Mods that edit companions looks/inventory/whatever directly.

#### More Perks

- Extremely old mod that predates modern script extenders, so many perks are broken or have poor implementation. Redundant Fallout 3 perks,
  spelling and grammar errors abound.

#### Most major overhauls to NV, like DUST

- Just no, will completely break the game due to leveled list changes and/or deleted forms.

#### NVEC - New Vegas Enhanced Content

- uses many unused records in FNV for it's own stuff, we use the same records because they're FO3 records, it WILL break TTW.

#### PCB Hotkey

- WILL break your game.

#### PLR - Point Lookout Reborn

- can be patched/reconverted, broken scripts and broken/dirty worldspace/cell edits

#### Project Nevada

- Outdated, broken, obsolete. See [Mods to Avoid](mods-avoid) for what to use instead.

#### Project Weaponry

- multiple incomplatible meshes, all iron sights broken with TTW.

#### Purge Cell Buffers

- WILL break your game.

#### Readius

- Use Universal Pip-Boy Customization mod. You must revert to arm mounted before doing Tranquility Lane and Anchorage and taking the train to Vegas the first time.

#### Star the Wandering Courier

- This mod is antithetical to our mission statement, which is to have a working, bug free as possible game.

#### The Storyteller

- dirty edits and incompatible conflicts.

#### Unlimited Companions

- janky mod from 2010, use JIP CCC instead

#### Unofficial Patch NVSE

- script and fix conflicts (not necessary)

#### Unofficial Patch Plus

- script and fix conflicts (not necessary)

#### WMX/WME (Weapon Mods Expanded)

- all meshes are incompatible with fixed animations and problems with texture sets, sound fixes and other issues.
- Use [Unique Weapons Upgradeable](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77809) instead.

#### WMIM (Weapon Mesh Improvement Mod)

- already included with TTW and more up to date. Not needed and will cause fix conflicts.

#### Weapons of the New Millenia

- Use [Another Millenia](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/76133) instead.

#### Weapons of the New Millenia and Friends

- CTDs and other quality issues; use [Another Millenia](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/76133) instead.

#### Weapons of the Wasteland

- Causes CTDs.

#### XFO

- Ancient; not even compatible with the current version of vanilla New Vegas.

#### YUP and other unofficial patch mods

- TTW comes with YUPTTW which patches almost all bugs and will continue to do so. TTW itself fixes bugs in Fallout 3 and New Vegas as well, sometimes supersedes fixes in YUP which are then removed from it. Regardless of what VUI+ wants, it is NOT compatible.

#### Zan Autopurge Crash Protector

- WILL break your game.

#### anything that alters the game's timescale

- Internal game functions are tied to time scale , changing them will break AI packages and other things.

## Probably Incompatible

#### Any TTW mod or patch made before November of 2018

- Version differences in TTW mean that compatibility is sometimes out of the question in this situation.

#### Any bug fix mods

- TTW/YUP fixes bugs in both games. If you are aware of a bug which isn't fixed, let the team know. Fixes in NVSE plugins are fine.

#### Custom Race Mods

- lack child races, cause CTDs.

#### Weapon sound overhauls

- make edits to weapon records breaking them, can be patched. Use [AWSOME](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77723).

## Minor Incomaptibilities

#### New Vegas Bounties II

- some of dogmeat's dialogue is hijacked for Guts, Roy is fixing up all of someguy's mods

#### Russell

- Ghoul doctor from Caruthers Canyon will walk to and appear in Underworld due to reused marker/package
- Someguy's mods are all being [remastered](content#the-someguy-series-le) with TTW patches.

#### VUI+ (non-TTW edition)

- Gives user message to install YUP. Don't install YUP; TTW comes with TTWYUP.
