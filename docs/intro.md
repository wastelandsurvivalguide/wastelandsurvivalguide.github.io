## About the Guide

Wasteland Survival Guide is a **modding guide** for Tale of Two Wastelands and not a "modlist." The sections are meant to be completed **sequentially**. Having said that, the guide is designed to be modular, so you can skip mods or entire sections of mods that you don't wish to install. No matter which mods you choose, you must then complete the [Final Steps](finish) section so they will be ordered correctly.

The guide assumes you are already familiar with the skills you learned during [**The Best of Times**](https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/), such as how to install mods with Mod Organizer 2. When in doubt, please reference that guide.

## Installing Mods

The majority of mods have no special installation instructions. This means that you simply click the **Mod Manager Download** button for the latest **Main File** for the given mod, then double-click it in the **Downloads** tab of MO2's right pane to install. If a mod _does_ have special instructions, they will be clearly indicated in the guide.

When installing multiple files from the same Nexus mod page, you will be prompted to "Merge, Rename or Replace." In these cases, you should **rename the file to its respective filename**. Additional details about—and exceptions to—this rule are covered in [The Best of Times - Mod Installation Instructions](https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/mo2.html#HowToUse?).
