:::caution Before we can even begin...

## About the Guide

Wasteland Survival Guide is a **modding guide** for Tale of Two Wastelands. It is not a "modlist": the sections should be completed **sequentially**. Having said that, the guide is designed to be modular, so you can skip mods - or entire sections of mods - that you don't wish to install. No matter which mods you choose, you must then complete the [Final Steps](finish) section so they will be ordered correctly.

The guide assumes you are already familiar with the skills you learned during [**The Best of Times**](https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/), such as how to install mods with Mod Organizer 2. If in doubt, review that guide.

:::danger Not Vortex Compatible
This guide uses [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) **exclusively**. The steps specifically pertain to MO2 features and cannot be completed on any other mod manager. Support will only be provided for MO2.

## Installing Mods

The majority of mods have no special installation instructions. This means that you simply click the **Mod Manager Download** button for the latest **Main File** for the given mod, then double-click it in the **Downloads** tab of MO2's right pane to install.

If a mod _does_ have special instructions, they will be clearly indicated in the guide.

### Merge, Rename, Replace?

When installing multiple mods from the same page through MO2, you should **Rename** to the **file name** of the file you downloaded, as described in [The Best of Times](https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/mo2.html#installation_instructions).
