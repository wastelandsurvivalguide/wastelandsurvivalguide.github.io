# Intro

:::caution Before we can even begin...

This guide does not cover the installation of Tale of Two Wastelands and Mod Organizer 2. 
You must have fully completed [**The Best of Times**](https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/)
before starting Wasteland Survival Guide.

## About the Guide

Wasteland Survival Guide is a **modding guide** for Tale of Two Wastelands. It is not a "modlist": the 
sections should be completed **sequentially**. Having said that, the guide is designed to be modular, so you
can skip mods - or entire sections of mods - that you don't wish to install. No matter which mods you choose, 
you must then complete the [Final Steps](finish) section so they will be ordered correctly.

The guide assumes you are already familiar with the skills you learned during 
[**The Best of Times**](https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/), such as how to install mods with 
Mod Organizer 2. If in doubt, review that guide.

:::danger Not Vortex Compatible

This guide uses [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194)
**exclusively**. The steps specifically pertain to MO2 features and cannot be completed
on [Vortex](tools-avoid#vortex) or any other mod manager. Support will only be provided for MO2.

## Installing Mods

The majority of mods have no special installation instructions. This means that you simply click the 
**Mod Manager Download** button for the latest **Main File** for the given mod, then double-click it 
in the **Downloads** tab of MO2's right pane to install.

If a mod *does* have special instructions, they will be clearly indicated in the guide.
